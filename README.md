# Coding-Quiz
Week 4 homework assignment

A timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peer

The Task
Create a multiple question quiz which includes a timer and a register of high scores.

Approach
The initial approach involved creating several files of HTML, CSS and JS in order to separate functions of the app. This proved confusing and difficult to maintain and was reverted to a single file from each.

Problems Encountered
Once required responses were identified, creating functions and their properties proved difficult and time consuming. 
The hardest part was creating the timer and getting it to subtract with incorrect answers.
